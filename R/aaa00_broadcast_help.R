#' @section Functions:
#' 
#' \bold{Broadcasted Operators} \cr
#' Base 'R' comes with relational (==, !=, etc.),
#' arithmetic (+, -, *, /, etc.), and logical/bit-wise (&, |) operators. \cr
#' 'broadcast' provides 2 ways to use these operators with broadcasting. \cr
#' \cr
#' The first (and simple) way is to use the \link{broadcaster} class,
#' which comes with it's own method dispatch for the above mentioned operators. \cr
#' This method support operator precedence, and for the average 'R' user,
#' this is sufficient. \cr
#' \cr
#' The second way is to use the large set of `bc.`- functions. \cr
#' These offer much greater control and more operators than the previous method,
#' and has less risk of running into conflicting methods. \cr
#' But it does not support operator precedence. \cr
#' \cr
#' More information about both methods can be found here: \cr
#' \link{broadcast_operators}. \cr
#' \cr
#' 
#' 
#' \bold{Binding Arrays} \cr
#' 'broadcast' provides the \link{bind_array} function,
#' to bind arrays along an arbitrary dimension,
#' with support for broadcasting. \cr
#' See \link{bind_array}. \cr\cr
#' 
#'  
#' \bold{Casting Functions} \cr
#' 'broadcast' provides several "casting" functions. \cr
#' These can facility complex forms of broadcasting that would normally not be possible. \cr
#' But these "casting" functions also have their own merit, beside empowering complex broadcasting. \cr
#' \cr
#' More information about the casting functions can be found here: \cr
#' \link{broadcast_casting}. \cr
#' \cr
#' 
#' \bold{General Pairwise Broadcasted Functions} \cr
#' 'broadcast' also comes with 2 general pairwise broadcasted functions:
#' 
#'  * \link{bc_ifelse}: Broadcasted version of \link[base]{ifelse}.
#'  * \link{bcapply}: Broadcasted apply-like function. \cr \cr
#' 
#' 
#' \bold{Other functions} \cr
#' 'broadcast' provides
#' \link[=as_bool]{type-casting} functions,
#' which preserve names and dimensions - convenient for arrays. \cr
#' \cr
#' 'broadcast' also provides
#' \link[=sd_lc]{simple linear algebra functions for statistics}. \cr
#' \cr
#' And 'broadcast' comes with some helper functions: \cr
#' \link{bc_dim}, \link{ndim}, \link{lst.ndim}, \link{rep_dim}. \cr \cr
#' 
#' 
#' @section Supported Structures:
#' 'broadcast' supports atomic/recursive arrays (up to 16 dimensions),
#' and atomic/recursive vectors. \cr
#' As in standard Linear Algebra convention,
#' dimensionless vectors are interpreted as column-vectors in broadcasted array operations. \cr
